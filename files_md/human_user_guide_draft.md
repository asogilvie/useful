# How to work with @asogilvie _[A. Stephanie Ogilvie]_

[(Table of contents up top!)](https://github.blog/changelog/2021-04-13-table-of-contents-support-in-markdown-files)

## Values 

### My biggest values

- Learning & Challenge
- Determination
- Discipline
- Adventure
- Transparency
- Fairness

### The things that can be expected from me as a result of those values

Don’t take it/me too seriously. Maybe my day doesn’t feel complete unless I get something done, but I also like to laugh a lot, collaborate on stuff, and I do my best to practice kindness.

### What qualities do you value in people who work with you?

You are perfect exactly as you are and I have much to learn from you. Can't wait!

## Time

### Scheduling | Calendar Notes

- I will generally attend calls scheduled between 08h00 and 17h00 M - F.

- I try to live as async as possible. I support reducing meeting loads at the host’s discretion.

- If needs must and I step out for a workout or appointment, I generally add a brb-note-moji to my slack status so you know whether and when I’ll be back that day.

- I’m not a morning person, unfortunately. My brain turns on somewhere around midday and I get much more done in the afternoon/evening/night.

- I may occasionally be online at odd hours of the night or weekend, but don’t worry about it; I’m likely just tending to last-minute inspirations or repetitive tasks.

### Rituals

The organization of the below depends on where my sleep cycle lands. En bref, everyday:
- I work[^1]
- I hobby[^2]
- I do a physical thing[^3]
- I read books/articles[^4]
- I meditate

## Communication (is awesome!)

### My feedback preferences

#### Giving
- 1:1 for constructive feedback.
- A bounty of sparkles for positive feedback.
- In terms of format, I will generally try to specify why in either case, use examples liberally, and assist in solution finding where desired.
- Please let me know if you have additional preferences - communication is awesome!

#### Receiving
- Yes, please.

#### What’s the best way to communicate with you?
- Frankly,
- On Slack,
- Or in issue comments.

## Wanna know some mo'?

### Past lives :: where did you come from?

Data stuff, various:
- Grad research in psychiatric epidemiology (specifically in PTSD) >>
- fintech variance reporting >>
- ecommerce price point & inventory forecasting >>
- political research & digital marketing >>
- video game ecommerce >>
- GITHUB [You are here!]

### Honest, unfiltered things about me:
- I am exactly as easygoing as I seem. Most things are fine.
- I love sci-fi.
- You’ll probably only ever see me wear black. I have dozens of black shirts, dresses, et cetera. I promise you’re not seeing the same one day-to-day.
- My diet is 10% tasty memes.

### What drives you nuts?
- Inefficiency.
- I don’t really have any ‘pet peeves’, though I won’t stand by if I see someone else being overlooked or put down.

### People might misunderstand about me
- If we’re in a call together, please be assured that my facial expression probably isn’t because of you or the topic. I’m not very good at being on camera and monitoring my face can be exhausting.
- I’m introverted, but I’m neither shy nor quiet. If there’s something that ought to be said, I’ll say it. Public recognition is not a motivator.
- I try to emoji/giphy a lot to soften the tone of my netspeak as I am occasionally direct. Plus there are some nifty slack-mojis out there and it’s good to make deliberate space for light-heartedness.

## Bonus

### In writing this I discovered:
- I don’t actually know all that much about myself, but it’s been a fun way to get to know teammates.
- That markdown has more to offer than I knew about.

### Here’s a bunch of quizzes I did along the way:

---
[^1]: Less on weekends, but I can get anxious if I don’t at least have a finger on the pulse.
[^2]: I take time to engage with personal projects that help me grow in areas I would not otherwise pursue. This varies based on where I'm at as a human - could be artistic, culinary, technical, et cetera. I might not be great at any of it any time soon, but the joy and humility are in the attempt.
[^3]: E.g. yoga, lifting, a long walk, et cetera.
[^4]: Tell me about your most recent read or favourite book! Always down to talk books!
